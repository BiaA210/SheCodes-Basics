              <strong>
                Islamic Golden Age was a period of cultural, economic, and
                scientific flourishing in the history of Islam.
              </strong>
              It is traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th
              century, and spanned the Islamic empire, with the richest centres
              of learning in Baghdad, Cairo, Cordoba, and Damascus. Over this
              period, Muslim scholars and polymaths from various parts of the
              world with different cultural backgrounds made significant
              advances in fields such as philosophy, mathematics, sciences,
              engineering, and healthcare.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>
                Medicine was a central part of medieval Islamic culture.
              </strong>
              Islamic physicians and scholars developed a large and complex
              medical literature exploring, analyzing, and synthesizing the
              theory and practice of medicine. Intellectual thirst,
              open-mindness, and vigor were at an all time high in this era.
              During the Golden Age of Islam, classical learning was sought out,
              systematised and improved upon by scientists and scholars with
              such diligence that Arab science became the most advanced of its
              day.

            Physicians of the Islamic Golden Age made important advances in the
            fields of human anatomy and physiology.
            <br /><br />
            Amongst these is the work of Ibn al-Nafis, a 13th-century Syrian
            physician, who made significant in cardiology. He was the first to
            correctly observe the structure of the heart, detailed in his
            predominant work, 'Commentary on the Anatomy of the Canon of
            Avicenna'. He also made the link of blood being “purified”
            (oxidised) in the lungs, and was the first to understand the
            mechanism of the pulse and touched upon the idea of capillaries as
            microscopic pores. His work corrected many misconceptions made by
            the works of other renowned physicians, and his observations were a
            major advance in the comprehension of the human body.
            <br /><br />
            11th-century Iraqi scientist Ibn al-Haytham made advances in the
            field of optics, explaining that the eye was an optical instrument
            and developing the theory for image formation, explained through the
            refraction of light rays passing between two media of different
            densities.
            <br /><br />
            Ahmad ibn Abi al-Ash'ath, a famous physician from 10th-century Iraq,
            described the physiology of the stomach in a live lion, making him
            the first person to initiate experimental events in gastric
            physiology.
            <br /><br />
            12th-centry Iraqi physician and traveller Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi
            made advances in osteology, correcting works of Greek physician
            Galen regarding the formation of the bones of the lower jaw
            (mandible), coccyx and sacrum after he had the opportunity to
            examine a large number of skeletons during the famine in Egypt in
            597 AH.

            Medical contributions made by medieval Islam included the use of
            plants as a type of remedy or medicine. Remedies used included
            Papaver somniferum Linnaeus, poppy, and Cannabis sativa Linnaeus,
            hemp. Many traditional remedies are still used across the world to
            this day, and as more are studied, modern tests prove many of them
            to be beneficial to the health of the human body.
            <br /><br />
            Islamic physicians lay the foundations for modern scientific
            experimentation by using methodical research and meticulous
            documentation of herbal remedies; at the time, Islamic physicians
            and scientists were the only ones using scientific experimentation.
            As the territory of the Islamic empire grew, new plants, seeds, and
            spices were discovered and tested for medicinal uses. Hospitals kept
            herbal garden, and many cultivated an extensive collection of
            medicinal plants.
            <br /><br />
            Ali al-Ruhawi believed that a physician must be a botanist and
            understand pharmacological characteristics of the various
            morphological parts. Islamic scholars produced numerous works on
            herbal remedies. The first book to document medicinal plants at the
            time was 'The Book of Plants', which was written by 9th-century
            Iranian al-Dinawari (known as the ‘Father of modern botany’). His
            work was of such importance at the time that physicians and
            pharmacists had to memorise it in order to be allowed to practise
            medicine.
            <br /><br />
            Other notable works included 'Dictionary of Simple Remedies and
            Food' by Ibn al-Baytar, which studied over three thousand plants;
            'The Collection of Simples, Medicinal Plants and Resulting
            Medicines' by Ibn Samajun, which classified many plants by their
            medical properties; and 'The Book of Simple Drugs' by al-Gafiqi,
            whose work was so accurate that it was republished in 1932.

            Surgical practices and equipment in the Islamic empire was the most
            advanced in the world, and still influence surgery in the modern
            day. Notable surgeons of the time included Ibn al-Haytham, a
            prominent eye surgeon; and Ibn Zuhr, who was known for his
            methodical experimental approach to surgery and whose distinguished
            work, ‘Book of Simplification concerning Therapeutics and Diet’
            prompted its evolvement.
            <br /><br />
            It was the scholar Al-Zahrawi (known as the ‘Father of modern
            surgery’) who had the greatest influence and impact on surgery. His
            thirty-volume treatise, ‘The Method of Medicine’, introduced a range
            of new surgical procedures and over 200 different surgical
            instruments, most of which are still used to this day. Al-Zahrawi’s
            influence was so great that his work was studied at prominent
            universities in the western world until the end of the 19th century.
            <br /><br />
            Many of the procedures carried out by Islamic surgeons were complex
            and intricate, and so required cutting edge surgical instruments.
            Such examples include forceps, hooks and various scalpels, most of
            which have received only small modifications when being adapted for
            use in modern surgical procedures. Similarly, some procedures
            invented by the surgeons of the Islamic Golden Age were still used
            well into the era of modern medicine, such as the use of catgut for
            internal stitching and the treatment of broken or disjointed bones
            through external pressure.
            <br /><br />
            In medieval Islamic society, antisepsis and anesthesia were
            important aspects of surgery. Ancient Islamic physicians attempted
            to prevent infection when performing procedures for a sick patient,
            for example by washing a patient before a procedure. Similarly,
            following a procedure, the area was often cleaned with “wine, wine
            mixed with oil of roses, oil of roses alone, salt water, or vinegar
            water” which have antiseptic properties, among other substances.
            Drugs to cause drowsiness, especially opium, were used to cause
            unconsciousness before operations, as a modern-day anesthetic would.

            Physicians like al-Razi wrote about the importance of morality in
            medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn
            al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics or "pratical philosophy" in
            Islamic medicine. Al-Razi wote his treatise ‘Book on Spritual
            Physick’ on popular ethics. He felt that it was important not only
            for the physician to be an expert in his field, but also to be a
            role model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three
            concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self,
            and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.
            <br /><br />
            The earliest surviving Arabic work on medical ethics is ‘Morals of
            the physician’ (or ‘Practical Medical Deontology’) and was based on
            the works of Hippocrates and Galen. Morals of the physician was
            al-Ruhawi's introductory comment to elevate the practice of medicine
            in order to aid the ill and enlist the help of God in his support.
            He quotes Hippocrates that the medical arts involve three factors:
            the illness, the patient, and the physician. The book consisted of
            twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics. In the
            first chapter of his book, al-Ruhawi declared that the truth is more
            important for physicians who follow rational ethics and the medical
            injunctions. Al-Ruhawi regarded physicians as "guardians of souls
            and bodies", and insisted them to use proper medical etiquette for
            strong medical ethics and not to ignore theoretical overtones. In
            pre-Islamic times, there were problems of a lack of part of an
            element of struggle and conflict to resolve ethical difficulties.
            Al-Ruhawi helped bridge this gap.

            Hospitals in the Islamic empire were some of the most advanced in
            the entire world. They were called Bimaristan, meaning "house of the
            sick". Bimaristan were built and maintained by funds raised through
            taxes called zakat and by charitable donations called Waqf so that
            treatments could be provided for free.
            <br /><br />
            Hospitals were secular, serving all people regardless of their race,
            religion, citizenship, or gender. The Waqf documents stated nobody
            was ever to be turned away. The ultimate goal of all physicians and
            hospital staff was to work together to help the well-being of their
            patients. There was no time limit a patient could spend as an
            inpatient; the Waqf documents stated the hospital was required to
            keep all patients until they were fully recovered.
            <br /><br />
            Men and women were admitted to separate but equally equipped wards.
            The separate wards were further divided into mental disease,
            contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and
            eye disease. Each hospital contained a lecture hall, kitchen,
            pharmacy, library, and prayer space. Recreational materials and
            musicians were often employed to comfort patients. Additionally,
            physicians and midwives were sent to the poorest, rural areas to
            care for those who were unable to travel to the hospitals. Indeed,
            when Ibn Jubayr passed though the Near East on his travels he
            remarked that “the hospitals are among the finest proofs of the
            glory of Islam.”
            <br /><br />
            Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients
            and their medical treatment. Records were referenced in future
            treatments. During this era, physician licensure became mandatory in
            the Abbasid Caliphate. In 931 AD, Caliph Al-Muqtadir learned of the
            death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician's error. He
            immediately ordered that doctors would be prevented from practicing
            until they passed an examination.

            Before the turn of the millennium, hospitals became a popular centre
            for medical education, where students would be trained directly
            under a practicing physician. The training of physicians in the
            Islamic empire was extremely meticulous and intensive. Students
            underwent both practical and theoretical lessons. They would shadow
            doctors and surgeons during their clinical rounds in order to gain
            experience in a practical environment.
            <br /><br />
            It was common practice for students to travel to different parts of
            the empire in order to be taught by the most reputable physicians of
            the time. As well as lectures and tutorage, the pupils also studied
            from textbooks and papers by well-known physicians. The rigorous and
            extensive education of these medical students allowed the physicians
            of the Islamic empire to be some of the most knowledgeable and
            accomplished in the world at the time.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of the hospital, physicians would teach students in lectures
            known as "majlises". Al-Dakhwār became famous throughout Damascus
            for his majlises and eventually oversaw all of the physicians in
            Egypt and Syria. He would go on to become the first to establish
            what would be described as a "medical school" in that its teaching
            focused solely on medicine. This all eventually led to the
            standardization and vetting process of medical education.

            The birth of pharmacy as an independent, well-defined profession was
            established in the early ninth century by Muslim scholars. The
            Islamic physician al-Kindi was the first to differentiate between
            medicine and pharmacology as a science and established the basics of
            medical formulary by uncovering how to determine correct drug
            dosage. The practice and duties of a pharmacist were outlined in
            al-Biruni’s book, ‘The Book of Pharmacology’; this book also gave
            detailed knowledge of the properties of almost all know drugs at the
            time, as well as giving the synonymous drug names in several
            languages including Persian, Greek, and Afghan.
            <br /><br />
            Sabur Ibn Sahl was a 9th-century physician who wrote the first text
            on pharmacy in his book ‘Book of medicines’. Islamicate pharmacy
            achieved the implementation of a systematic method of identifying
            substances based on their medicinal attributes. In addition, Sabur
            also wrote three other books on pharmacy, and although his works was
            not enforced by the government authorities, they were widely
            accepted in the medical circles.
            <br /><br />
            A major advance to drug development came when al-Zahrawi established
            the processes of sublimation and distillation when preparing
            medicines, allowing a whole new assortment of medicines to be
            manufactured; al-Zahrawi also pioneered the use of catgut parcels in
            which to store drugs before ingestion, a technique which was a
            forerunner to the use of drug capsules for modern medications.
            <br /><br />
            As well as establishing the science and philosophy of pharmacy, the
            practice was closely monitored and supervised by government
            officials known as muhtasib, who were periodically sent to check the
            quality and legitimacy of the dispensaries and pharmacists. They
            were tasked with testing the purity and quality of the drugs being
            sold and the accuracy of the equipment such as weights and measures,
            as well as getting rid of charlatans. These maintained the integrity
            of the practice and ensured that all customers were provided with
            the treatments that they required.

            The pain and medical risk associated with childbirth was so
            respected that women who died while giving birth could be viewed as
            martyrs. Medical scholars recognized the importance of family
            planning, primarily through contraceptives and abortion. The topic
            of contraceptives and abortion had been very controversial
            throughout the western world; however, in Islamic culture, due to
            the ties between women's reproductive health and one's overall
            well-being, medieval Muslim physicians devoted time and research
            into recording and testing different theories in this field.
            <br /><br />
            Medical journals and other literature from this time show an
            extensive and detailed list of a variety of different drugs and
            plant derived substances that supposedly have abortifacient
            qualities. Many of these substances were later laboratory tested and
            found to be correctly identified in their ability to induce a
            miscarriage. Further development in this field led to the
            introduction of contraceptives that would prevent one's need to
            induce a miscarriage.
            <br /><br />
            Abortions were frequently sought after by women of this time. It is
            clear that the Islamic culture not only incorporated, but brought
            about positive connotations in regards to women's reproductive
            health. During a period in which men dominated medicine, the almost
            immediate inclusion of women's reproductive health in medical texts,
            along with a variety of different techniques and contraceptive
            substances, long before the development of 'the pill', reinforces
            the cultural belief that men and women were to be viewed as equals,
            in regards to sexual health.
            <br /><br />
            The role of women as practitioners appears in a number of works
            despite the male dominance within the medical field. Two female
            physicians from Ibn Zuhr's family served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf
            Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century,
            female surgeons were illustrated for the first time in Şerafeddin
            Sabuncuoğlu's ‘Imperial Surgery’. Female doctors, midwives, and wet
            nurses have all been mentioned in literature of the time period.

            One area of medicine which was greatly contributed to by the work of
            Islamic physicians was ophthalmology. Islamic physician Hunayn ibn
            Ishaq produced ten prominent works on field of ophthalmology, in
            which he depicted the first ever anatomic illustrations of the eye.
            Islamic oculists were also known to use modern terms in their
            writings, for instance, ‘cornea’, ‘conjunctiva’, ‘uvea’, and
            ‘retina’. <br /><br />
            It is thought that this field was especially pursued, especially in
            places such as Egypt, due to the prevalence of eye diseases caused
            by desert dust. As a result, many major breakthroughs were made in
            the treatment of these diseases, the most renowned of which was the
            cure for cataracts. Developed by the Iraqi physician al-Mawsili, and
            documented in his book Choice of Eye Diseases, the treatment
            involved using a hollow needle, designed by al-Mawsili, to remove
            the cataract by suction. The treatment has only a few modern
            modifications in the modern world due to advanced technology, but
            the original treatment of couching cataracts still lives on in some
            countries, predominantly those in Southern Asia.
            <br /><br />
            Al-Mawsili wasn’t the only prominent oculist of the Islamic Golden
            Age; al-Gafiqi developed a treatment of the eye disease trachoma,
            which was used until the First World War; Ibn al-Nafis wrote a
            prominent textbook on ophthalmology called ‘The Polished Book on
            Experimental Ophthalmology’. However, by far the most prominent
            oculist was Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal. Ibn Isa’s predominant work ‘The
            Notebook of the Oculist’, was the most comprehensive and accurate
            text book on ophthalmology ever written at the time, covering over
            130 different diseases of the eye and remaining the supreme
            authority in its field for centuries, even being translated into
            Latin.

            Practices in Islamic medicine was concerned with the prevention of
            disease and illness along with than finding cures, especially
            through basic hygiene and cleanliness. Common practices included
            washing five times a day before each prayer, and the brushing of
            teeth using a miswak twig, which has since been proven to contain
            anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, reducing gum
            infections and tooth decay. Furthermore, the use of soaps was
            commonplace, made using oil and al-qali (root of the word ‘alkali’),
            which was a salt-like substance made from sodium carbonate and
            potassium carbonate; the mixture was boiled and left to harden;
            decorative coloured and perfumed soap was made as well as medicinal
            soaps. At the same time in Europe soap was unheard of and wasn’t
            introduced until the 18th century. <br /><br />
            In fact, hygiene was so significant to Muslims that it was
            considered as a medical science rather than a separate practice.
            Al-Zahrawi even included a treatise on ‘Medicines of Beauty’ in his
            book ‘The Method of Medicine’, which described the care of teeth,
            hair, and skin among other parts of the body. Treatments included
            the strengthening of gums and whitening of teeth, as well as the use
            of nasal sprays, mouth washes, sun lotion, and hand creams.
            <br /><br />
            As well as external hygiene, Muslims were also concerned with their
            internal cleanliness. Numerous damaging dietary practices were
            banned by the teachings of the Shari’ah, including the consumption
            of pork, alcohol, and other intoxicants. Other dietary habits such
            as fasting and eating less than desired were also encouraged. The
            importance of a healthy diet played a very significant role in
            Islamic medicine, with the first ever scientific book on food and
            regimen of health, ‘The Book of Diet’ being written by Ibn Zuhr
            during the 11th century.

            Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Latinized: Rhazes) was one of the
            most versatile scientists of the Islamic Golden Age. A Persian-born
            physician, alchemist, and philosopher, he is most famous for his
            medical works, but he also wrote botanical and zoological works, as
            well as books on physics and mathematics. Many of his books were
            translated into Latin, and he remained one of the undisputed
            authorities in European medicine well into the 17th century. He was
            considered by many to be the father of Islamic medicine due to the
            way he refined the scientific method and promoted experimentation
            and observation as the most reliable way to carry out research.
            <br /><br />
            Arguably his greatest achievement was ‘The Comprehensive Book on
            Medicine’, which compiled most of the known medical knowledge from
            the time. Also known as ‘The Virtuous Life’, this
            twenty-three-volume encyclopaedia was a posthumous compilation of
            Rhazes’ medical notes that he made throughout his life in the form
            of extracts from his reading, as well as observations from his own
            medical experience. Al-Razi cited Greek, Syrian, Indian, and earlier
            Arabic works, and also included his own research. This included one
            of his most significant and celebrated studies, a clinical
            characterisation of smallpox and measles which allowed the two
            diseases to be distinguished from each other for the first time. The
            works covered every branch of medicine, with each volume dealing
            with specific parts or diseases of the body.
            <br /><br />
            ‘The Comprehensive Book on Medicine’ remained one of the most
            respected medical textbooks, not only in the Islamic world, but also
            in the West for several centuries. It remained an authoritative
            textbook on medicine in most European universities, regarded until
            the seventeenth century as the most comprehensive work ever written
            by a medical scientist.
            <br /><br />
            Rhazes also produced over two hundred other books on medicine and
            philosophy, among which notable titles included ‘The Diseases of
            Children’, which was the first book to deal with paediatrics as an
            independent field of medicine; and ‘A Medical Advisor for the
            General Public’, the first medical manual directed specifically at
            the general public, which included treatments for a range of common
            ailments such as headaches, colds, and coughing.
            <br /><br />
            Another of Rhazes’ greatest successes lay in his progressive stance
            towards the ethics of medicine. He wrote extensively on the nature
            of relationship between a doctor and their patient, believing that
            it should be built on trust, and heavily condemned the practices of
            charlatan doctors who extorted the afflicted by selling fake cures.
            Therefore, Al-Razi established himself not only as one of Islam’s
            most knowledgeable physicians, but also one of great moral standing,
            whose progressive medical ethics helped shape the legitimacy and
            integrity of the medical practice for centuries to come.

            Abu-Ali al-Husayn ibn Abdullah ibn-Sina (Latinized: Avicenna) was
            Perian polymath and physician of the tenth and eleventh centuries.
            He was known for his scientific works, but especially his writing on
            medicine. He has been described as the "Father of Early Modern
            Medicine".
            <br /><br />
            Ibn Sina is credited with many varied medical observations and
            discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne
            transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric
            conditions, recommending use of forceps in deliveries complicated by
            fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial
            paralysis, and describing guinea worm infection and trigeminal
            neuralgia.
            <br /><br />
            By the age of sixteen he was already researching and practicing
            medicine, and during his career he wrote a total of 276 works, 43 of
            which were in medicine. In 1025, he completed his most famous work,
            ‘Code of Laws in Medicine’, otherwise known simply as the ‘Canon’.
            The Canon is comprised of five different books which cover different
            aspects of medicine, compiling previously known information and
            Avicenna’s own research: General Medical Principles, Material
            Medica, Diseases Occurring in a Particular Part of the Body,
            Diseases Not Specific to One Bodily Part and Recipes for Compound
            Remedies. Its arrangement, comprehensiveness and methods of
            explanation very closely follow the format of modern medical
            textbooks, and consequently the Canon became the most widely used
            medical textbook in Europe and the Islamic empire up until the 17th
            century; its influence was so enduring that it was still in use at
            Brussels University until 1909.
            <br /><br />
            While the Canon was by far Ibn Sina’s most celebrated book, his most
            widespread work during the Islamic Golden Age was his ‘Medical
            Poem’, which was summarised basic medical principles into poetic
            form, so easing their memorisation by medical students. His other
            works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicines, and
            treatment of kidney diseases.

            with medical cures and the maintenance of good health, and is
            dedicated to the caliph Ma'mun. It was regarded at his time as an
            important work of literature in the science of medicine, and the
            most precious medical treatise from the point of view of Muslimic
            religious tradition. It is honoured by the title "the golden
            treatise" as Ma'mun had ordered it to be written in gold ink. In his
            work, Al-Ridha is influenced by the concept of humoral medicine.

            The first encyclopedia of medicine in Arabic language was by Persian
            scientist Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari's Firdous al-Hikmah
            ("Paradise of Wisdom"), written in seven parts, c. 860 dedicated to
            Caliph al-Mutawakkil. His encyclopedia was influenced by Greek
            sources, Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, and Dioscurides. Al-Tabari,
            a pioneer in the field of child development, emphasized strong ties
            between psychology and medicine, and the need for psychotherapy and
            counseling in the therapeutic treatment of patients. His
            encyclopedia also discussed the influence of Sushruta and Charaka on
            medicine, including psychotherapy.

            Al-Tamimi, the physician (d. 990) became renown for his skills in
            compounding medicines, especially theriac, an antidote for poisons.
            His works, many of which no longer survive, are cited by later
            physicians. Taking what was known at the time by the classical Greek
            writers, Al-Tamimi expanded on their knowledge of the properties of
            plants and minerals, becoming avant garde in his field.

            'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi (died 994 AD), also known as Haly
            Abbas, was famous for the Kitab al-Maliki translated as the Complete
            Book of the Medical Art and later, more famously known as The Royal
            Book. Considered one of the great classical works of Islamic
            medicine, it was free of magical and astrological ideas and thought
            to represent Galenism of Arabic medicine in the purest form. This
            book was translated by Constantine and was used as a textbook of
            surgery in schools across Europe. The Royal Book has maintained the
            same level of fame as Avicenna's Canon throughout the Middle Ages
            and into modern time. One of the greatest contributions Haly Abbas
            made to medical science was his description of the capillary
            circulation found within the Royal Book.

            Ibn Buṭlān, otherwise known as Yawānīs al-Mukhtār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn
            ʿAbdūn al-Baghdādī, was an Arab physician who was active in Baghdad
            during the Islamic Golden Age. He is known as an author of the
            Taqwim al-Sihhah (The Maintenance of Health تقويم الصحة), in the
            West, best known under its Latinized translation, Tacuinum Sanitatis
            (sometimes Taccuinum Sanitatis). The work treated matters of
            hygiene, dietetics, and exercise. It emphasized the benefits of
            regular attention to the personal physical and mental well-being.
            The continued popularity and publication of his book into the
            sixteenth century is thought to be demonstration of the influence
            that Arabic culture had on early modern Europe.

              <strong>
                Medieval Islam's receptiveness to new ideas and heritages helped
                it make major advances in medicine during this time.
              </strong>
              <br /><br />
              Medieval Islamic scolars added to earlier medical ideas and
              techniques, expanding the development of the health sciences and
              corresponding institutions, and advancing medical knowledge in
              areas such as surgery and understanding of the human body. Despite
              this, many Western scholars have not fully acknowledged its
              influence (independent of Roman and Greek influence) on the
              development of medicine. Through the development of hospitals,
              scientific methods, and surgical techniques, as well as
              discoveries in fields such as physiology, pharmacy, and
              ophthalmology, medieval Islamic scholars had a massive influence
              on laying the foundations for modern medicine.
              <br /><br />
              As well as the immense amount of practical knowledge they
              contributed to the medical field, Islam’s greatest contribution
              was less in specific remedies, but rather more in the overarching
              wisdom and philosophy its physicians bestowed upon the medical
              practice. Perhaps the greatest demonstration of Muslim values was
              summarised in the constitution establishing the al-Mansuri
              hospital in Cairo: “It’s [the hospital’s] duty to give care to the
              ill, poor, men and women until they recover. It is at the service
              of the powerful and the weak, and the poor and the rich, of the
              subject and the prince, of the citizen and the brigand, without
              demand for any form of payment, but only for the sake of God, the
              provider.” Islamic medicine of the Golden Age helped shape the
              morality and integrity of the medical practice for centuries to
              come.
